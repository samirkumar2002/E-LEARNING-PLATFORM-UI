# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK PERFORMED:

CoderHub is a styled and interactive multi-page front-end web application designed to simulate the core functionalities of an E-Learning platform. This project was developed with the goal of providing users a seamless and engaging learning experience through features like course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding — all implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The homepage of CoderHub presents a clean and user-friendly interface that welcomes learners with a motivational tagline and a call-to-action button encouraging them to browse available courses. This landing page also highlights the platform’s key features such as high-quality video tutorials, real-time progress tracking, and beginner-friendly learning paths. A featured courses section previews some of the popular offerings, helping users quickly navigate to their interests.

The Courses page (courses.html) acts as a catalog where multiple courses are listed using card-style layouts. Each card displays the course name, a short description, and a link to view more details. This structure is responsive and ensures clarity and simplicity for users browsing through learning options.

The Course Detail page (course-detail.html) is where actual learning begins. This page includes an embedded YouTube video that plays directly within the platform, eliminating the need to leave the website. Alternatively, local videos can also be embedded using the HTML5 <video> tag. This fulfills the video embedding requirement and ensures that learners can watch tutorials directly on the platform.

A significant feature of CoderHub is the Progress Tracking page (progress.html). Here, learners can track their completion status for different courses using interactive progress bars. When a user clicks the "Complete Lesson" button, the progress bar updates in real-time using JavaScript, visually reflecting the user's progress. Though the progress is simulated for front-end purposes, it creates a realistic sense of achievement and is easily extendable to backend storage in the future.

To enhance the user experience further, a Dark Mode toggle is included and accessible from every page. This feature allows users to switch between light and dark themes dynamically, with their preference being saved in local storage to persist across sessions. This interactivity is achieved using simple DOM manipulation via JavaScript and CSS class toggling.

From a technical standpoint, CoderHub is built purely with HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions. The folder structure is organized with separate directories for stylesheets and scripts, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

CoderHub does not involve any backend or server-side code, making it lightweight and ideal for showcasing front-end web development skills. It demonstrates a solid grasp of key web technologies while simulating core features of modern e-learning systems such as Coursera or Udemy.

In conclusion, CoderHub is a complete, functional, and visually appealing front-end prototype of an E-Learning platform. It meets all specified requirements — course listing, progress tracking, video embedding, styling, and interactivity — making it a perfect submission-ready project and a strong portfolio piece for any front-end developer or student.
